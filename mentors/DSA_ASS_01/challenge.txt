Problem 1 :-

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step



Problem 2 :-

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4

Problem 3:-

Given an array of integers. Find the numbers whose occurence in the array is odd. 

Note: Integers are from 0 to 100 and length of array is greater than the max value in Array

For eg: 
Input: [1,3,4,2,4,1,4]

Output: [3,4,2]; Since 3 & 2 is repeated once, 4 is repeated three times.
